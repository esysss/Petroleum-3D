# Petroleum-3D
One of the extensions of our paper on 2D (Which can be accessed here https://github.com/esysss/Petroleum-2D) petroleum was to create a more realistic environment which is a 3D area where the merging can occur in the X, Y, and Z axes. The results of our runnings are stored in the Store folder.
